        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <p class="sprint-core-body">
          Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) is the ability to understand, use, and
          manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others,
          overcome challenges and defuse conflict. Emotional intelligence helps you build stronger relationships,
          succeed at school and work, and achieve your career and personal goals. It can also help you to connect with
          your feelings, turn intention into action, and make informed decisions about what matters most to you.

        <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
        <p class="sprint-core-body">
          As we know, it’s not the smartest people who are the most successful or the most fulfilled in life. You
          probably know people who are academically brilliant and yet are socially inept and unsuccessful at work or in
          their personal relationships. Intellectual ability or your intelligence quotient (IQ) isn’t enough on its own
          to achieve success in life. Yes, your IQ can help you get into college, but it’s your EQ that will help you
          manage the stress and emotions when facing your final exams. IQ and EQ exist in tandem and are most effective
          when they build off one another.

          Emotional intelligence refers to a person's ability to perceive, control, evaluate, and express emotions.
          Researchers such as John Mayer and Peter Salovey, as well as writers like Daniel Goleman, have helped shine a
          light on emotional intelligence, making it a hot topic in areas ranging from business management to education.

        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
        <p class="sprint-core-body">
          Emotional intelligence is widely recognized as a valuable skill that helps improve
          communication, management, problem-solving, and relationships within the workplace. It is also a skill that
          researchers believe can be improved with training and practice.

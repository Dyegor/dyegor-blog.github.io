        <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
        </h2>
        <p class="sprint-core-body">
          First of all, I realized that I need to work on my collaboration and improve the ability to deligate tasks.
          The second thing is, I need to work on my time management (sometimes I really forget to take breaks).
          Lastly, I will have to practice a lot to master my interpretation skills in order to be able to explain
          technical things to non-technical users and vice versa.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="sprint-core">
        <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
        </h2>
        <p class="sprint-core-body">
          To be successful in programming, like any other job, you need to really love what you do.
          The road to becoming a good programmer is very long, so you need to understand that this is what you want to
          do your whole life.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="sprint-core">
        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        </h2>
        <p class="sprint-core-body">
          Even familiar things can look different when you look at them from a different angle.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="sprint-core">
        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </h2>
        <p class="sprint-core-body">
          Learn to adjust to things that are outside your comfort zone.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="sprint-core">
        <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
          development bootcamp course?
        </h2>
        <p class="sprint-core-body">
          We all have different backgrounds and different personalities, so the core learning is to teach us how to work
          together efficiently and productively.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="sprint-core">
        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used
          that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </h2>
        <p class="sprint-core-body">
          Not really, I'm interested in learning something else besides the programming itself.

      <div class="sprint-core">
        <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
        </h2>
        <p class="sprint-core-body">
          My long term goal is to become a full stack developer, not limited to web applications, but other programming
          languages like python, C # and many more. I hope to learn the new technical skills that are popular today.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="sprint-core">
        <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
        </h2>
        <p class="sprint-core-body">
          My greatest strengths are my conscious choice to become a developer and my passion for programming. I do not
          have
          illusions about this, because I understand that the path to my goal will not be easy, but I am ready for it.
          I don't see any limitation that Bootcamp might have.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="sprint-core">
        <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
        </h2>
        <p class="sprint-core-body">
          Teamwork, because we are all newbies and do not know how to work with each other. I just hope that my
          teammates are reliable and responsible.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="sprint-core">
        <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
        </h2>
        <p class="sprint-core-body">
          Since I've always worked alone, I really want to learn how to split and pass tasks to others.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="sprint-core">
        <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
        </h2>
        <p class="sprint-core-body">
          To gain new skills and knowledge, challenge myself, and become the best version of myself.
